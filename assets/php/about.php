			<tab to="INDENT">The Galactic New Accountability Resource, or 
			GNAR for short, is an institution 
			founded on principle. With only 
			a handful of software engineers, 
			the GNAR has set about making a 
			difference in the galkactic 
			community. With connections in 
			over 500 regions, GNAR works with 
			local governments to allocate resources 
			for galactic preservation.
			It is important to find alternatic methods of 
			galactic mining, energy production, and waste 
			dispsal practices necessary for the galaxy to 
			thrive. Galaxy adoption entails 
			much more than your average house 
			pet adoption. Many Galaxies
			are in different ranges of crisis, 
			depending in part by their specific environmental 
			needs. Certain criteria has to be met to sustain the 
			Galaxy if we have any hope of bringing 
			them back from the brink of desolation. 
			<br><br>
			<tab to=t1>With your help, GNAR is able to procure 
			land and resources needed to achieve 
			these goals. GNAR facilitates a very 
			thorough and detailed record of all 
			activities sponsors donate to. 
			With streaming video and daily blogs, 
			you can	actually see your dollars at 
			work! While some of these galaxies may actually be adopted, most have 
			strict legal restrictions to private citizen ownership. 
			GNAR helps facilitate acquiring the necessary permits to 
			adopt. For the other galaxies that can't be privately owned, GNAR 
			helps in other ways.
